Hi Karen,

There are links that need to be made manually in the PRC to have these show up on the site.  I cannot do linking on the back-end, but I can give you the direct URLs to these assets as they are present in the PRC 2.0 and available for company-wide usage.  I have cc’d David and Ali who may be able to help update the links provided they have bandwidth and time.

We launched the WD Global Edition in JAPAC and EMEA last October 15 and we are currently preparing for the Partner launch session here in JAPAC which is scheduled for Monday.  In our meeting today, we found a few assets missing from PRC, but they are available in Seismic:
